ðŸ”§ Setup and Installation
To get this project running on your own Firebase instance, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/momentum-app.git](https://github.com/your-username/momentum-app.git)
cd momentum-app

Create a Firebase Project:

Go to the Firebase Console.

Create a new project.

Add a new "Web App" to your project.

Enable Firestore Database and Anonymous Authentication in the Firebase console.

Configure the Application:

Open the index.html file.

Find the <script type="module"> section.

Inside the script, locate the firebaseConfig object placeholder. Replace it with the configuration object provided by Firebase when you created your web app.

(Optional) This app is designed to work with environment variables (__app_id, __firebase_config, __initial_auth_token) injected at runtime. If you are not using such an environment, you must hardcode your firebaseConfig.

Run the Application:

Simply open the index.html file in your favorite web browser. You can use a simple live server extension in your code editor for the best experience.

This will connect the application to your personal Firebase backend, and you can start managing your tasks immediately.
